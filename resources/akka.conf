    # There are a few edge cases.
    # If you have a case where the number of threads is equal to the number of actors
    # using the dispatcher, set the number extremely high, like 1000.
    # 
    # If your actors perform tasks that will take some time to complete
    # and you need fairness to avoid starvation of other actors sharing the pool,
    # set the throughput to 1.
